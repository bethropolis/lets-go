## Hello, Go!

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}

```

- **`package main`**: This line declares that this Go file belongs to the `main` package, which is the entry point for any Go executable. You'll see this in every Go program.

- **`import "fmt"`**: This line imports the `fmt` package, which provides functions for formatting and printing text. It's a standard package that's frequently used for printing to the console.

- **`func main() {...}`**: This is the `main` function. It's the entry point for your program. When you run your Go program, it starts executing from here.

- **`fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")`**: This line uses the `Println` function from the `fmt` package to print "Hello, Go!" to the console. `Println` is used for printing with a newline character at the end, so each call to it starts a new line in the output.

**Extra Tips and Notes:**

- Go programs must start with a `main` package and contain a `main` function. This is where program execution begins.

- The `import` statement is used to bring in external packages. The `fmt` package is essential for input/output operations.

- You can run this program by opening your terminal, navigating to the folder where your Go file is located, and running `go run filename.go`, where `filename.go` is the name of your Go source file.

- If you want to create a standalone executable, you can use `go build` to compile the code into an executable binary.

- Go has a simple and elegant syntax that emphasizes readability and clarity.
